First is that there is most likely a preprogrammed function to read in data, either in .txt or .csv formats. This is great, as we don't have to worry about manually programming using input and output modules. Secondly, and more importantly, these canned functions most likely DO NOT like strings and therefore will throw an error if it tries to read in a line of headers. There are ways of dealing with this but the most simple way, and what we will be using, is to <b>SKIP READING IN THE HEADER LINE</b>.</p>\n",
